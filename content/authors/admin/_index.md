I am Yusen Feng (冯雨森), a Ph.D student from [Center on Frontiers of Computing Studies (CFCS)](http://cfcs.pku.edu.cn), Peking University, advised by [Prof. Libin Liu](http://libliu.info/). I have a broad range of interests, with a particular focus on the control of physics-based character animation, biologically-plausible control design, and muscle actuator simulations. My interest in physics, especially mechanics and natural phenomena, was sparked in high school and further nurtured during my undergraduate studies. I also personally enjoy exploring physical phenomena related to fluids and soft bodies.
